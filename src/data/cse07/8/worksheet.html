	<h2>Introduction </h2>
	 <p>
First normal form (1NF or Minimal Form) is a normal form used in database normalization. A relational database table that adheres to 1NF is one that meets a certain minimum set of criteria. These criteria are basically concerned with ensuring that the table is a faithful representation of a relation and that it is free of repeating groups.

<div id="theory">
	<h2>Theory/Procedure </h2>

<p>First Normal Form (1NF) sets the very basic rules for an organized database:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eliminate duplicative columns from the same table.</li>
<li>Create separate tables for each group of related data and identify each row with a unique column (the primary key).</li>
</ul>

<p>What do these rules mean when contemplating the practical design of a database?  It&#8217;s actually quite simple.</p>

<p>The first rule dictates that we must not duplicate data within the same row of a table.  Within the database community, this concept is referred to as the atomicity of a table.  Tables that comply with this rule are said to be atomic.  Let&#8217;s explore this principle with a classic example &#8211; a table within a human resources database that stores the manager-subordinate relationship.  For the purposes of our example, we&#8217;ll impose the business rule that each manager may have one or more subordinates while each subordinate may have only one manager.</p>

<p>Intuitively, when creating a list or spreadsheet to track this information, we might create a table with the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager</li>
<li>Subordinate1</li>
<li>Subordinate2</li>
<li>Subordinate3</li>
<li>Subordinate4</li>
</ul>
<p>However, recall the first rule imposed by 1NF: eliminate duplicative columns from the same table.  Clearly, the Subordinate1-Subordinate4 columns are duplicative.  Take a moment and ponder the problems raised by this scenario.  If a manager only has one subordinate &#8211; the Subordinate2-Subordinate4 columns are simply wasted storage space (a precious database commodity).  Furthermore, imagine the case where a manager already has 4 subordinates &#8211; what happens if she takes on another employee?  The whole table structure would require modification.</p>

<p>At this point, a second bright idea usually occurs to database novices: We don&#8217;t want to have more than one column and we want to allow for a flexible amount of data storage.  Let&#8217;s try something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager</li>
<li>Subordinates</li>
</ul>
<p>where the Subordinates field contains multiple entries in the form "Mary, Bill, Joe"</p>
<p>This solution is closer, but it also falls short of the mark.  The subordinates column is still duplicative and non-atomic.  What happens when we need to add or remove a subordinate?  We need to read and write the entire contents of the table.  That&#8217;s not a big deal in this situation, but what if one manager had one hundred employees?  Also, it complicates the process of selecting data from the database in future queries.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a table that satisfies the first rule of 1NF:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager</li>
<li>Subordinate</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, each subordinate has a single entry, but managers may have multiple entries.</p>
<p>Now, what about the second rule: identify each row with a unique column or set of columns (the primary key)?  You might take a look at the table above and suggest the use of the subordinate column as a primary key.  In fact, the subordinate column is a good candidate for a primary key due to the fact that our business rules specified that each subordinate may have only one manager.  However, the data that we&#8217;ve chosen to store in our table makes this a less than ideal solution.  What happens if we hire another employee named Jim?  How do we store his manager-subordinate relationship in the database? </p>

<p>It&#8217;s best to use a truly unique identifier (such as an employee ID) as a primary key.  Our final table would look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manager ID</li>
<li>Subordinate ID</li>
</ul>

<div id="Simulation">
	<h2>Simulation</h2>

Lets consider the following example of a database consisting of persons, their age and the places they live.

{{{id=1|
s = """
       kiran  20  Mum,Delhi
       Ram    18  Hyd,vizg
       shyam  16  Hyd,blr,nlr
    """
///
}}}

After converting this table into First normal form, the result would be as follows:

{{{id=2|
import re
rows = s.split("\n")
for i in rows:
    i = i.strip()
    attributes = re.split("\s+",i)
    l = []
    l.append(attributes[0])
    for j in range(1,len(attributes)):
        tokens = attributes[j].split(",")
        if (attributes[j].find(",") > 0):
            for k in range(len(tokens)-1):
                l.append(l[0])
            for k in range(len(tokens)):
                    l[k] += " " + tokens[k]     
        else:
            for k in range(len(l)):
                l[k] += " " + tokens[0]        
    for j in l:
        print j
///
Ram 18 Hyd
Ram 18 vizg
shyam 16 Hyd
shyam 16 blr
shyam 16 nlr
}}}

{{{id=3|

///
}}}

The repetitions in the tables are removed, which is the main objective of a database in First normal form.
